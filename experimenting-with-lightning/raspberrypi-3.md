# RaspberryPi 3

## Notable implementations

## Raspibolt

The [RaspiBolt project](https://github.com/Stadicus/guides/tree/master/raspibolt) will show you how to set up everything from scratch, some basic linux knowledge is required. For testnet and mainnet. __

## Raspiblitz

_The_ [_RaspiBlitz_](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz) _serves as a shortcut through_ [RaspiBolt project](https://github.com/Stadicus/guides/tree/master/raspibolt) _setup process with some changes and an additional LCD display so that you can quickly experiment with a Lightning node and start working on your LApps on a hacking event \(or at home\). This shortcut is fine for testnet usage and maybe trying some small things on mainnet. But if you choose to go full reckless afterwards … please consider taking the time and work thru the original RaspiBolt project. Don’t trust us, verify._
