# RaspberryPi 3

## Notable implementation

_the_ [_RaspiBlitz_](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz) _serves as a shortcut through this setup process with some changes and an additional LCD display so that you can quickly experiment with a Lightning node and start working on your LApps on a hacking event \(or at home\). This shortcut is fine for testnet usage and maybe trying some small things on mainnet. But if you choose to go full reckless afterwards … please consider taking the time and work thru the original RaspiBolt project. Don’t trust us, verify._
