## ARTF: Almost ready to fly solution

ARTF Lightning Node is the easiest way to get started with Lightning and a Bitcoin full node.

Plug and play, pre-synced, and easy to setup and use. Make and receive Lightning payments, no coding required.

Included in the box:  
\* A Lightning Node pre-assembled and pre-synced  
\* Built with Raspberry Pi 3B+ and 1 TB Seagate HDD  
\* Hard drive adapter cable  
\* 3 foot Ethernet cable   
\* AC power adapter

I could process a limited set of order, and ship a ready to use Lightning server node based on Raspiblitz. Cost 300$
